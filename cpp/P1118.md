# P1118 [USACO06FEB] Backward Digit Sums G/S

## 题目描述

`FJ` and his cows enjoy playing a mental game. They write down the numbers from $1$ to$ N(1 \le N  \le 10)$ in a certain order and then sum adjacent numbers to produce a new list with one fewer number.  They repeat this until only a single number is left.  For example, one instance of the game (when $N=4$) might go like this:

```cpp
    3   1   2   4
      4   3   6
        7   9
         16
```
Behind `FJ`'s back, the cows have started playing a more difficult game, in which they try to determine the starting sequence from only the final total and the number $N$.  Unfortunately, the game is a bit above `FJ`'s mental arithmetic capabilities.


Write a program to help `FJ` play the game and keep up with the cows.

## 说明/提示

- 对于 $40\%$ 的数据，$1\le n\le 7$；  
- 对于 $80\%$ 的数据，$1\le n \le 10$；
- 对于 $100\%$ 的数据，$1\le n \le 12$，$1\le sum\le 12345$。
